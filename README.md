# UFC-Data-Modeling
This is a passion project of mine after recently getting interested in the UFC and MMA scene. The project: ingests the dataset into PostgreSQL; analyzes fighter stats and outcomes; predicts winners based on historical performance; visualizes insights via an interactive dashboard; and delivers a polished report showcasing findings.
